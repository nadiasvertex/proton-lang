@cindex Memory operations

The following functions are provided to set, copy, compare, and search
memory blocks.

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memset ({void *} dest, int ch, {unsigned int} len)
Set the @code{len} bytes at @code{dest} to the value @code{ch}.
Returns @code{dest}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memcpy ({void *} dest, {const void *} src, {unsigned int} len)
Copy the @code{len} bytes at @code{src} to @code{dest}.  Returns
@code{dest}.  The behavior is undefined if the blocks overlap
(use @code{jit_memmove} instead for that case).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memmove ({void *} dest, {const void *} src, {unsigned int} len)
Copy the @code{len} bytes at @code{src} to @code{dest} and handle
overlapping blocks correctly.  Returns @code{dest}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int jit_memcmp ({const void *} s1, {const void *} s2, {unsigned int} len)
Compare @code{len} bytes at @code{s1} and @code{s2}, returning a negative,
zero, or positive result depending upon their relationship.  It is
system-specific as to whether this function uses signed or unsigned
byte comparisons.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {void *} jit_memchr ({void *} str, int ch, {unsigned int} len)
Search the @code{len} bytes at @code{str} for the first instance of
the value @code{ch}.  Returns the location of @code{ch} if it was found,
or NULL if it was not found.
@end deftypefun
